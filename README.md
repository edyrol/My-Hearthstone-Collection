# My-Hearthstone-Collection

Creats a file named "MyCollection.txt" containing the cards you have and the practicall number of copies. It makes no distinction between golden and non-golden cards.

This is based on HearthstoneCollectionExporter (https://github.com/edyrol/HearthstoneCollectionExporter) and therefore requires HearthDb.dll (https://github.com/HearthSim/HearthDb) and HearthMirror.dll (https://github.com/HearthSim/HearthMirror).
