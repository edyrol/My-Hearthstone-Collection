# My-Hearthstone-Collection

Creats a file named "MyCollection.txt" containing the cards you have and the practicall number of copies.
It makes no distinction between golden and non-golden cards.
Hearthstone needs to be running in order for the collection to be exported.

The format is as follows:

	Card_Name Number_of_copies

This is based on [HearthstoneCollectionExporter](https://github.com/edyrol/HearthstoneCollectionExporter) and therefore requires [HearthDb.dll](https://github.com/HearthSim/HearthDb) and [HearthMirror.dll](https://github.com/HearthSim/HearthMirror).
